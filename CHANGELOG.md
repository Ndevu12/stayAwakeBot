# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Release-pipeline hardening:** a **CycloneDX SBOM** of the wheel's resolved dependencies,
  generated in the build job and attached to each GitHub Release; a **`pip-audit` gate** that
  fails the release on a known-vulnerable dependency; and the container scan is now a **Trivy
  gate** (build → scan → push) that blocks a fixable critical/high *before* the image is pushed.
- **Public GitHub Action moved to its own repository, [`Ndevu12/strix`](https://github.com/Ndevu12/strix)**
  ("StayAwakeBot Strix" on the Marketplace): adopt the security sentinel with
  `uses: Ndevu12/strix@v1`. Strix is a thin composite Action that installs the published
  `stayawakebot` scanner from PyPI and runs `stayawake-security-scan` — the detection engine
  stays in the package, so no scan logic is duplicated. The in-repo `.github/actions/worm-scan`
  composite is kept for this project's own self-gating (`worm-guard.yml`) and from-source pins;
  the superseded root `action.yml` wrapper was removed.
- **Container image on GHCR** (`ghcr.io/ndevu12/stayawakebot`), built and published by the
  release pipeline's `docker` job on each `v*` tag — removes the host Python 3.14 prerequisite.
  Multi-stage, digest-pinned base, non-root, built from the same wheel as PyPI, with SLSA
  provenance + SBOM attestations and a Trivy scan. Adds `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore`.
- Versioned-release pipeline (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): tag-triggered build →
  self-scan gate → PyPI publish via Trusted Publishing (OIDC, no stored token) with PEP 740
  attestations → GitHub Release. Manual `workflow_dispatch` path publishes to TestPyPI.
- `docs/RELEASING.md` maintainer runbook (one-time PyPI/TestPyPI Trusted-Publisher setup,
  release steps, and the remaining hardening backlog: SBOM, protected-environment reviewers).
- This changelog.

### Changed
- **Lowered the minimum Python to 3.13** (`requires-python >=3.13`, was `>=3.14`) — the code
  uses no 3.14-only features, so this widens who can `pip install stayawakebot`. Verified by
  running the full test suite on a real Python 3.13 interpreter (96/96 pass).
- **Distribution renamed to `stayawakebot`** on PyPI (`stayawake` is owned by an unrelated
  project). The import package and console scripts are unchanged — only `pip install <name>`
  differs.
- Version is now derived from the git tag via `hatch-vcs` instead of being hand-edited in
  `pyproject.toml`.
- The source distribution (sdist) is now an explicit allowlist (`src/`, README, LICENSE,
  CHANGELOG, pyproject) so it no longer ships `reports/`, `.github/`, or local config.
- `hatch-vcs` now derives the version only from `vX.Y.Z` tags (`git_describe_command` match),
  so the moving Marketplace major tag (`v1`) cannot be mistaken for the package version.

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

Initial public release: Health sentinel (uptime monitoring) and Security sentinel
(supply-chain worm detection, remediation, prevention) under one `stayawake` package.
