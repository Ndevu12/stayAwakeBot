# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Versioned-release pipeline (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): tag-triggered build →
  self-scan gate → PyPI publish via Trusted Publishing (OIDC, no stored token) with PEP 740
  attestations → GitHub Release. Manual `workflow_dispatch` path publishes to TestPyPI.
- `docs/RELEASING.md` maintainer runbook (one-time PyPI/TestPyPI Trusted-Publisher setup,
  release steps, and the remaining hardening backlog: SBOM, protected-environment reviewers).
- This changelog.

### Changed
- **Distribution renamed to `stayawakebot`** on PyPI (`stayawake` is owned by an unrelated
  project). The import package and console scripts are unchanged — only `pip install <name>`
  differs.
- Version is now derived from the git tag via `hatch-vcs` instead of being hand-edited in
  `pyproject.toml`.
- The source distribution (sdist) is now an explicit allowlist (`src/`, README, LICENSE,
  CHANGELOG, pyproject) so it no longer ships `reports/`, `.github/`, or local config.

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

Initial public release: Health sentinel (uptime monitoring) and Security sentinel
(supply-chain worm detection, remediation, prevention) under one `stayawake` package.
